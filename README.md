# MySQL-Python EDA and Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project that demonstrates the following steps:

**1. SQL Script Execution:** Creation of a MySQL database and populating it with data.

**2. Python Setup:** Setting up a Python environment with necessary libraries.

**3. Data Extraction:** Using MySQL Connector for Python to extract data into a Pandas DataFrame.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**** Summary statistics, data cleaning, and data visualization.

**5. Optional Machine Learning Task:** Selecting, preprocessing, training, and evaluating a machine learning model.
